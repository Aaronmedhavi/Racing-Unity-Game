## ⚙️ Mechanics

### Gamepad Input
Experience different ways to play with the use of a gamepad integrated with unity input system. Control your braking and acceleration precisely and control your steering using joystick for better handling.

### AI Racer Opponent
Race against AI opponent in a challenging track, made possible with the use of waypoints throughout the track to guide the cars around the track and back. Waypoints also help determine the position of each car allowing for accurate positioning update for each cars in the track.

### Optimization
The game is optimized using occlusion culling to ensure that the camera only renders what it can see and nothing else. This method ensures a smooth FPS throughout the experience with no noticeable frame drops.
